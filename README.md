## Summary 

...

## To be or not be ?

Difficult to know who we really are, right ?

With a question like that you would have guessed I'm either a socratic philosopher or a freaking psy...

So let’s go for a kind of psychiatrist, neuroscientist and a little bit nutritionist...

I got my M.D. in psychiatry in 2013. Since 2013, I worked as a senior psychiatrist at Lyon University Hospital. I took part in the creation (and then in the management...) of a Tertiary Referral Centre for Eating Disorders. I also worked at the Integrative Center for Obesity as referal psychiatrist, especially for the assessment before bariatric surgery. I completed my  doctoral studies in neurosciences in parallel of my clinical hospital activity. I 

During my PhD, I studied the markers of vulnerability to food disinhibition in obesity. My work led me to develop a comprehensive model of food intake control. My thesis work has demonstrated the importance of considering the addiction transfer from a product (i.e. tobacco) to food (manuscript in preparation). Using artificial intelligence and machine-learning , I also proposed an ultra-fast screening test for food addiction (Iceta S et al., Eating and Weight Disorder, 2020, under review). Another part of my PhD work was about the measurement of event-related potential (EEG cognitive function reflect) in obese participants with or without food disinhibition. This study demonstrated a potential neurobiological overlap between addictions and food disinhibition (Iceta S et al. Int J Obes, 2019). I have also shown that ghrelin may play an important role in this food disinhibition (Iceta S et al., 2019, Diabetes Metab).

My PhD studies in neuroscience and my professional experience as a psychiatrist specialized in obesity and eating disorders had me work alongside many patients suffering from severe obesity and binge eating disorder. This led me to better understand why some people are more vulnerable than others to an obesogenic environment and are at higher risk of developing obesity. Since 2015, I am conducting pre- and post-bariatric surgery clinical assessment. This expertise confronts me to the “honeymoon” phenomenon. After bariatric surgery, we clinically observe a major improvement of eating behavior, at least during the first year which correlates with dynamic weight loss. Interestingly, we observe a trend for a behavioral turn back coincident with body weight stabilization or weight regain after this period. I am convinced that solutions to manage and prevent obesity and eating disorders will emerge from better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this “honeymoon” period. For these reasons, I chose to focus my future research on neurobehavioral factors of food intake and appetite control as well as their interaction with endocrine and gut signals, as critical determinants of appetite regulation, disordered eating and excessive weight gain.


After graduating from my PhD in January 2019 I decided to move on a postdoctoral fellow... in nutrition....

 My postdoctoral is focusing in neuroimaging and neuroendocrine aspects of food intake. It started in septembre 2019 and i should stay in Quebec until septembre 2021 (maybe more...). I have chosen to pursue my postdoctoral studies under the supervision of Pr Andreanne Michaud and the co-supervision of Pr Andre Tchernof at the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute—Laval University. The Quebec Heart and Lung Institute represents one of the best places to improve my training in bariatric surgery. Indeed, the bariatric surgery team is one of the most important in the world, with their pioneering work leading to new surgical approaches. They operate more than 650 patients per year and have been able to maintain high follow-up rates for up to 20 years.

In addition, I have had the privilege of getting married and raising twins who are now almost 6 years old… To relaxe I love scubadiving, especially scuba diving below 100 feet, I love the peacefulness you can find there.

And to finish introducing myself, I loved the course on the terminal that reminded me my childhood with floppy disks 5.25

## Project definition 

### Background

Obesity is a neurobehavioral disorder resulting from a vulnerable brain exposed to an obesogenic environment1. Structural and functional brain alterations induced by obesity may explain the link between obesity and cognitive dysfunction2. Whether these changes can be reversed after weight loss is unclear. Bariatric surgery represents the most effective treatment for severe obesity, leading to sustained weight loss and long-term metabolic recovery3. Besides these well-known metabolic recoveries, recent studies have shown improvement in cognitive functions and food preferences4. However, the impact of bariatric surgery on brain structure and function has been scarcely addressed and most studies were performed in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). It is essential to better understand the impact of weight loss and metabolic improvements on brain function, cognitive functions and eating behaviors, especially in long-term.

The overall objective is to better characterize brain function, appetite behaviors and cognitive function prior to as 4, 12 and 24 months after bariatric surgery. We will test the hypothesis that: i) bariatric surgery induces functional and structural changes in brain regions involved in cognitive control and dietary decisions, which improve feeding behaviors and cognitive performance; ii) these changes are associated with improvement in metabolic alterations and inflammation after surgery.

To perform this project, we currently recruit participants with severe obesity scheduled to undergo bariatric surgery (30 participants with Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG), 30 with RYGB, 30 biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and 30 obese controls). 94 participants have been recruited so far. Participants undergo 4 MRI sessions (before as well as 4, 12 and 24 months after surgery). 

The MRI protocol includes: 

1) anatomical T1-weighted scan to measure grey and white matter density using voxel-based morphometry; 

2) resting-state fMRI to measure functional brain connectivity; 

3) fMRI during the Becker-Degroot-Marshak food auction task5. During this task, participants are instructed to bid money on high or low calorie food items. This task assesses the subjective value of food. A general linear model will be applied to model the BOLD responses to high versus low-calorie food cues. 

Fasting blood samples is collected to measure plasma glucose, insulin, lipid profile, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LPB), interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein levels. At each visit, participants fill out validated questionnaires to assess eating behaviors and personality traits. Inhibitory control is measured using the Stop Signal Reaction Time Task and Delay Discounting task.

This relevant study combines bariatric, neuroimaging, neurocognitive and metabolic research in a novel approach to understand the effect of weight loss and metabolic changes on brain function, appetite behaviors and cognitive functions. Showing a reversal of neurological dysfunction associated with obesity will have very strong implications for clinical practice.

### Special Focus for the Brain Hack School

PreProcessing and Resting State Analysis

### Tools 

The "project template" project will rely on the following technologies: 
 * [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), to structure the text.
 * The [Hugo website framework](https://gohugo.io) which is used by the BHS website. This makes it possible to easily add the markdown project description to the website. 
 * Adding the project to the website relies on github, through pull requests. 

### Data 

Ultimately, the project template will be used by all BHS participants. Data on the different projects will be aggregareted on the [following page](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/project). This will serve as an additional example gallery in the years to come for future brainhack school students. Many reports from [BHS 2019](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019) already used this template. 

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - The current markdown document, completed and revised.
 - A gallery of the student projects at Brainhack 2020.
 - Instructions on the website about how to submit a pull request to the [BrainHack School website](https://github.com/BrainhackMTL/school) in order to add the project description to the website. 

## Results 

### Progress overview

The project was swiftly initiated by P Bellec, based on the existing template created in 2019 by Tristan Glatard and improved by different students. It was really not that hard. Community feedback is expected to lead to rapid further improvements of this first version. 

### Tools I learned during this project

 * **Meta-project** P Bellec learned how to do a meta project for the first time, which is developping a framework while using it at the same time. It felt really weird, but somehow quite fun as well. 
 * **Github workflow-** The successful use of this template approach will demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate dozens of students presentation on a website collaboratively over a few weeks. 
 * **Project content** Through the project reports generated using the template, it is possible to learn about what exactly the brainhack school students are working on. 
 
### Results 

#### Deliverable 1: report template

You are currently reading the report template! I will let you judge whether it is useful or not. If you think there is something that could be improved, please do not hesitate to open an issue [here](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/project_template/issues) and let us know. 

#### Deliverable 2: project gallery

There is not yet a project gallery, as BHS 2020 is the first edition that will incorporate it on the website. You can still check out the [2019 BHS github organization](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019)

##### ECG pupilometry pipeline by Marce Kauffmann 

The repository of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann). The objective was to create a processing pipeline for ECG and pupillometry data. The motivation behind this task is that Marcel's lab (MIST Lab @ Polytechnique Montreal) was conducting a Human-Robot-Interaction user study. The repo features:
 * a [video introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch/8ZVCNeX42_A) to the project.
 * a presentation [made in a jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann/blob/master/BrainHackPresentation.ipynb) on the results of the project.
 * Notebooks for all analyses.
 * Detailed requirements files, making it easy for others to replicate the environment of the notebook.
 * An overview of the results in the markdown document.
